note:
	Instead of refreshing the page JavaScript updates current page without redirection and then sends the new note to server.

Browser->Server POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
Server-->Browser json-data to inform that note is created

note:
	Browser also asks for a favicon.ico but I ignore it for now.
